The data for this work will be obtained by web scraping the website http://www.nwlink.com/~ufocntr/. The collection contains data covering the period 2015-2017. Once th data has been obtained, the second step would be to focus on the locations and dates of the reports. Based on the data collected, I will conduct an inquiry upon the places registering the majority of reports, and analysing the number and location on a day by day basis. The idea comes from the curiosity to quantify the number of reports and see whether UFO reports are more likely to happen in specific locations.

The data collected contains the following fields: City : The city where the report was registered. State: The (US) state where the reports comes from. Date / Time: The date and time of the encounter. Duration: The duration of the event. Posted: The date when the event was reported. Shape: The shape of the unidetified flying object. Summary: The description of the event by a witness. While the information contained is quite interesting, in this part I will be working on the fields city, state, date / time as these fields are closely related to the objectives of this study.

Given the size of the data collected the full dataset is stored in a MongoDB instance. For this project the version 3.6.1 has been used.
